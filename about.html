        <h1>About us</h1>
        <section>
            <p>Rainy Days was started by a couple of nature loving friends, desperate to escape the mundane, and experience the profound. They saw the need to help other adventurers not waste a day due to the fear of discomfort. 

            </p>
            <p>Let our jackets handle the unnecessary discomfort from the weather, and you're free to experience the life affirming discomfort of looking down from the highest peaks, watching the world zap past you while skiing down the slopes or, whatever else you feel the need to experience. Regardless of your desires we at Rainy Days believe in pushing the(right) comfort zone. 
            </p>
