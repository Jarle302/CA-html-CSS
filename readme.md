This was my crosscourse project at Noroff. We started this in the beginning learning about figma, then gradually built upon it as we learned more. Going from a figma design, to html and css, to adding javascript and in the end using wordpress as a headless CMS to fetch the product details.

## Description

This project as been with me all school year, and show how much i've learned since i started at noroff. There are alot of mistakes i've had to make, and have learned most from those. In the end im happy to have this project as a starting point, but would make several changes if i could do it again. Example the product cards are to cluttered.
