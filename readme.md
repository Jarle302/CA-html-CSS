# Rainy Days Ca

## Description

This is my html and css CA. I chose the Rainy Days project.

## Changes from Initial design

Homepage:

I was reccomended by Micheal John Phillip in my teacher review to make the site not so vertically long, by only using one background image instead of two(i had three on mobile aswell). I followed his advice, and made the changed he suggested in the video. A consquence of this is that i had to remove some headings aswell.

He also pointed out that it was unnecessary having the logo on the homepage when it's a part of the header, so i removed that. 

I've also struggled to make the text readable, by having it white it got flagged by wave for having to low contrast, which got fixed by changing in to black, but then it was plain to the naked eye that the text was hard to read. My solution ended up being to have a low opacity backgroundcolor which was enough to give it the needed contrast. On the unordered list i added a orange border which combined with the background color added some style to the change.
